        <p>Keeping track of all the mushrooms you find in the wild can be a difficult task. Using a map with pins alone is inadequate to provide all the information you might want to revisit. ShroomLogger enables you to upload pictures, descriptions and locations to create a complete history of your favorite fungi locations. Happy hunting!</p>
